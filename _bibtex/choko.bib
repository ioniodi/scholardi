abstract = {Various aspects of computational thinking (CT) could be supported by educational contexts such as simulations and video-games construction. In this field study, potential differences in student motivation and learning were empirically examined through students' code. For this purpose, we performed a teaching intervention that took place over five weeks, with two-hour sessions per week, plus two more weeks for the pretest and post-test projects. Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects' code analysis. Moreover, the video-game context seems to better motivate students for future engagement with computing activities.},

 abstract = {Pedagogy has emphasized that physical representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. There are many tangible hardware platforms for introducing computer programming to children, but there is limited comparative evaluation of them in the context of a formal classroom. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning to code for tangible computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for the desktop computer. For this purpose, 36 students participated in a within-groups study that involved three types of target computer platform tangibility. 1) desktop, 2) wearable, and 3) robotic. We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the studentsâ€™ performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision). Our findings suggest that computer programming should be introduced through multiple target platforms (e.g., robots, smartphones, wearables) to engage children.},

  abstract    = {Digital geographical maps can be regarded as a user interface for understanding and navigating the city. Nevertheless, contemporary digital maps over-emphasize the needs of motor vehicles. Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

attracting students with different needs and expectations. In this field study, we empirically examined different forms of
serious-game use for learning on learning performance and attitudes of eighty 13-year-old students in the first grade of middle
school. Divided into four groups of 20 students, each group practiced with a maths video game in three ways. The first group
played the storytelling maths game, the second played the same game but with no story and the third played and modified the
video game. Finally, a control group practised in a paper-based (traditional) way by solving exercises. Although only minor
differences in learning performance were identified, we found significant differences in the attitudes of the students toward
learning through the video game. Students who are not motivated by conventional paper-based assignments might be engaged better
with the use of a video game. Our findings suggest that video game pedagogy could provide malleable learning for different
groups of students using methods that move beyond the conventional tool-based approach.},

  abstract      = {Co-located collaboration on large vertical screens has become technically feasible, but users are faced with
increased effort, or have to wear intrusive personal identifiers. Previous research on co-located collaboration has assumed
that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in
turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during
shared tasks (Fig. 1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig. 1b) and personal action windows (Fig. 1c) for
co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for
it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords
performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task,
which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users'
behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space
negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and
interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along
with personal action windows.},

the geographic analysis of incidents. There are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford further processing and analysis. Existing
systems have emphasized the collection, analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular and
interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time data. As a remedy, we have built an
open-source project and we have been operating an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in
real-time with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number of precisely geo-located status
updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
flu-positive reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open- source approach and offer
linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem of applications and services, and in order to be
transparent to the general public interest.},
