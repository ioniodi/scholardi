BiHELab interests lie within educational, research and development activities in the areas of neurogenerative diseases and their relations with mitochondrial abnormalities and skin cancers, Rna-Protein interaction problem, the mathematical modeling of mitochondrial motility, alternative mathematical representations and optimized algorithms for RNA closed secondary structures and bioethics.

The electrophysiological laboratory houses instruments for intra and extracellular recordings in vivo and in vitro, and equipment for behavioral studies and equipment for both tethered and telemetric field potential recording.
